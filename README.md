# HiDDeN
Pytorch implementation of paper "HiDDeN: Hiding Data With Deep Networks" by Jiren Zhu*, Russell Kaplan*, Justin Johnson, and Li Fei-Fei: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09937  
*: These authors contributed equally

The authors have Lua+Torch implementation here: https://github.com/jirenz/HiDDeN
